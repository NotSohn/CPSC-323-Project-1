## How to run the program

This program will be running in C++ and will require gcc to run.

1. Linux

- sudo apt update
- sudo apt install build-essential

2. MacOS

- brew install gcc

3. Windows

- [https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/](minGW) and download the latest version for windows
- As you are installing the program, make sure you check "mingw32-gcc-g++-bin"
- After that you must change the environmental variable which can be found in
  - Windows Explorer > Right click on This PC > Properties > Advanced system settings > Environment Variables
- At the bottom "System Variables" panel, look for a Variable named "Path" and double click on it. Some systems show a good UI for adding a New Path easily (by clicking New), else you just need to add ; at the end and add the following path: C:\MinGW\bin (ASSUMING YOU DID NOT ALTER THE DEFAULT INSTALLATION PATH)
- Click on OK, and OK and close the other windows.
